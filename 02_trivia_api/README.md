# Udacitrivia

## Introduction
This project is a trivia app developed to:

1. **Display** questions. 
2. **Add** questions.
3. **Delete** questions.
4. **Search** for questions.
5. Play the **quiz game**, randomizing either all questions or within a specific category. 

It makes part of the Full-Stack Web Developer nanodegree API development practice projects. 

This lesson objective is to  
learn structuring and implementing well formatted API, as well as to apply Test-Driven Development (TDD) in the process of development.

All backend code follows [PEP8 style guidelines](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/).
